### üêï What is husky
Husky improves your git commits.

You can use it to lint your commit messages, run tests, lint code, etc... when you commit or push. Husky supports all Git hooks.

#### ü™ù Hooks
- pre-commit: lint app codebase
- commit-msg: apply commintlint

### üìã What is commitlint

commitlint checks if your commit messages meet the [conventional commit format](https://conventionalcommits.org).

In general the pattern mostly looks like this:

```sh
type(scope?): subject  #scope is optional; multiple scopes are supported (current delimiter options: "/", "\" and ",")
```

Real world examples can look like this:

```
chore: run tests on travis ci
```

```
fix(server): send cors headers
```

```
feat(blog): add comment section
```

Common types according to [commitlint-config-conventional (based on the Angular convention)](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum) can be:

- build
- chore
- ci
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=nexth&filter=next.js&utm_source=nexth&utm_campaign=nexth-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

Original template was forked from https://github.com/wslyvh/nexth

Underlying wallet manage and design systems were changed, but the template is continuing to use the original folder structure, plus other developer experience optimizations.

Thank you @wslyvh üôè
